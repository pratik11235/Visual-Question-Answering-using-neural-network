Information regarding the folder and dataset:

This folder contains 3 files:
1. VQA.ipynb - main source code file
2. Project report
3. training weights (obtained and stored while training the NN model)

The dataset is not included in the submission as the dataset size is more than 20 GB.
Below are the onedrive links of the dataset folders that I have used.
